# Supermarket Sales Analysis

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of supermarket sales using Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. It includes exploratory data analysis, visualization of sales trends, customer behavior patterns, product preferences, and correlation analysis.

## Usage

1. **Requirements:**
   - Programming Language: `Python 3.x`
   - Libraries: `pandas`, `plotly`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

2. **Instructions:**
   - Clone the repository or download the `supermarket sales analysis.ipynb` notebook.
   - Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Open and run the notebook `supermarket sales analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. **Output:**
   - Visualizations including pair plots, heatmaps, histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, and more to explore various aspects of supermarket sales data.
   - Statistical summaries and insights into sales trends, customer demographics, and product categories.

## Files

- `supermarket sales analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `supermarket_sales - Sheet1.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new columns based on date and time.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics of numerical and categorical data.
- **Sales Analysis:** Total sales, gross income analysis by city, product line, and customer type.
- **Visualization:** Pair plots, heatmaps, histograms, pie charts, scatter plots to visualize relationships and trends.
- **Customer Behavior:** Analysis of customer preferences, payment methods, and rating correlations.
